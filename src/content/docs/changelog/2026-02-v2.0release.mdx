 ## What's New

- The CLI can now initialize projects with Tailwind v4.
- Full support for the new `@theme` directive and `@theme inline` option.
- All components are updated for Tailwind v4 and React 19.
- We've fixed and cleaned up the style of the components.
- **`Motion library`** is now used instead of Framer Motion for all animations.

**Note: This is a breaking release.

ScrollX UI v2.0 components are built for **Tailwind CSS v4** and **React 19**.
They are **not compatible** with Tailwind v3 without modification.

### Install Motion

To use the new Motion library, install it with your preferred package manager:

<DepsOptions name="motion" />

Then import it in your project like this:

```tsx 
import { motion } from 'motion/react';
```
